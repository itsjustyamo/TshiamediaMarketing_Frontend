# Tshiamedia Marketing Frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository of Tshiamedia Marketing, a website created by Tshiamo Tsoku for a marketing agency called "Tshiamedia Marketing".

## Overview
Tshiamedia Marketing Frontend is built using React and Vite. It serves as the client-side interface for the Tshiamedia Marketing website, allowing users to interact with the various features and content.

## Features
- Home page: Provides an overview of Tshiamedia Marketing and its services.
- Services page: Details the services offered by Tshiamedia Marketing.
- Contact Us page: Allows users to get in touch with Tshiamedia Marketing.
- Login page: Provides access to authenticated features (not implemented yet).

## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A build tool that provides a fast development server and optimized builds.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.

## Difficulties Faced
- Connecting frontend and backend: It was challenging to establish communication between the frontend and backend to ensure seamless data flow.
- Styling: Implementing consistent and visually appealing styles using Tailwind CSS required some experimentation and fine-tuning.
- External API integration: Integrating external APIs and managing their data in the application posed some challenges.

## What I'm Proud Of
I'm proud of the overall look and feel of the website and how the different pages function together to provide a cohesive user experience. Additionally, I'm proud of overcoming the challenges faced during development and successfully implementing the core features of the website.

## Future Improvements
If I had more time, I would focus on implementing authentication functionality on the login page to enhance security and provide access to authenticated features.
